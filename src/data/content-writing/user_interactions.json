    "Log in or log on, sign in or sign up?": "Use 'sign in' and 'sign up' for clarity and modern tone. Consistency reduces user confusion.",

    "Void or refund?": "'Void' stops unprocessed transactions. 'Refund' returns money after processing. Precision builds trust.",
    "Choose or select?": "'Choose' is conversational; 'select' is formal and UI\u2011specific. Align tone with product voice.",
    "Tap/Click, touch, press or hold?": "Use platform\u2011specific terms. Maintain consistency for user clarity.",
    "Try again or retry?": "'Try again' is friendly; 'retry' is technical. Choose based on tone context."
